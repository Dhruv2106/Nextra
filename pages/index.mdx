# Introduction

The Orbiwise network solution comprises a number of server applications that manages different aspects of the network functionality. Each of these servers generate a log files with transactional data as well as statistics data and debugging information. The Orbiwise Server Logs Analyser and Viewer (OSLAV) Tool is a powerful tool that can read and analyze these logs file. This tool is also known as Trace. The tool allow the following basic features:
<br></br>


- Inspect all data being sent on the network.
- Decoding of payload of all known (i.e., AppKey known) devices.
- Graphical visualization in the time domain of any parameters (including payload data).
- Flexible filtering of data. Filters can be:
  - Simple textual match filters.
  - Based on extracted information or on raw log file with all available information.
  - Timestamp range.
- Data extraction and export. Export selected data (parameters and/or payload data) to file for e.g., quick integration with Excel, Matlab, etc.
- Web interface. Backend can run on a local PC (Windows/Linux/OSX) or on a remote server.

# Architecture Overview
The figure below shows the overall architecture of the server application logging and Trace.

Each of the Orbiwise server applications write data and debug information to a log-file that is stored locally on the server. Each Sunday at 24:00 each server will close its log-file and create a new one so that the logging information for each server is available in files with one week of logging information each.

Trace processes both the current active log-files as well as the old log files. How far back (i.e. how many weeks of log-files) is customizable by the user. Trace backend continues to read and parse the log-files to extract the main information for viewing in a web-browser.

Trace uses Mongodb for data storage purpose.
